#### SparkExercisesEtl timezone

If you want to use another timezone, modify the current value in the config file (spark_exercises_etl.conf), 
the workflowtemplate being used, and in the initialization action that the Dataproc cluster executes.

code -> spark session timezone (used for internal Spark SQL and Dataframe operations)
workflowtemplate -> JVM timezone (used for logging, if not informed Spark JVM uses the system timezone)
initialization action -> cluster/system timezone (for coherence, not really needed)
